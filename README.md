# crx-triage
This is a deep learning personal project that allows chest X-ray analysis and triage using available medical imaging datasets. The objective of this project is to develop automated detection on pulmonary conditions. Lastly, I used models like YOLOv9 and RT-DETR in the training pipeline.
